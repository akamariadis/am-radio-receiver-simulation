# AM-RADIO-SIMULATION

This repository includes a comprehensive PDF guide detailing the design and construction of an AM (Amplitude Modulation) radio receiver circuit, developed for the course "Introductory Lab of Electronics and Telecommunications" taken during the third semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. Additionally, it features a Python script that simulates the circuit's functionality (the generation and demodulation of an amplitude-modulated (AM) signal), allowing users to analyze and visualize its performance. Whether you're interested in hands-on circuit building or exploring signal modulation through simulation, this resource offers both practical and theoretical insights into AM technology.
